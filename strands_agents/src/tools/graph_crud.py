    Create a new node in the graph.
    
    This tool creates a single node with specified label and properties,
    with validation against allowed schemas and labels.
    
    Args:
        label: The node label (e.g., "Person", "Process", "Department", "System")
        properties: Dictionary of node properties (e.g., {"name": "Alice", "role": "Engineer"})

    Safety measures:
        - Label must be in allowlist (Person, Process, Department, System)
        - Properties are validated against schema
        - Payload size is limited

    Create a relationship between two existing nodes.
