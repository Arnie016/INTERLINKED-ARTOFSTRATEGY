# Data Generation and Loading Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the mock data generation system with the Neo4j backend through the DataLoaderAgent, enabling seamless data generation and visualization in the frontend.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated Company Sizes
- **Small**: 5 employees (was 10-50)
- **Medium**: 15 employees (was 50-200) 
- **Large**: 30 employees (was 200-1000)

### 2. Implemented New Ratios
- **1 Employee : 3 Processes** - Each employee owns/participates in 3 processes
- **1 Department : 3 Employees** - Each department has approximately 3 employees
- **1 Project : 3 Employees** - Each project involves approximately 3 employees

### 3. Enhanced Data Connectivity
- All employees are connected through `Reports_To` relationships (hierarchical structure)
- All employees are connected through `Works_With` relationships (collaboration network)
- Ensures no isolated employees in the organizational graph

### 4. Removed Communications
- Eliminated all communication data generation
- Focus solely on Entities (Employees, Departments, Projects, Processes, Systems) and Relationships
- Simplified data structure for better performance

### 5. Updated DataLoaderAgent
- Added `reset_and_load_data()` method for comprehensive graph reset and data loading
- Enhanced error handling and status reporting
- Improved file loading with better relationship mapping

### 6. Updated API Integration
- Modified `/api/generate-sample-data` endpoint to use DataLoaderAgent
- Streamlined data flow: Generate → Reset Graph → Load Data → Return Status
- Better error handling and response formatting

### 7. Updated Frontend
- Corrected company size display options
- Maintained existing UI/UX while reflecting accurate employee counts

## Technical Implementation

### Mock Data Generation (`tools/mock_generation.py`)
```python
# New size parameters
self.size_params = {
    "small": {
        "employees": 5,
        "departments": 2,  # 5 employees / 3 = ~2 departments
        "projects": 2,     # 5 employees / 3 = ~2 projects
        "processes": 15,   # 5 employees * 3 = 15 processes
        "systems": 3
    },
    "medium": {
        "employees": 15,
        "departments": 5,  # 15 employees / 3 = 5 departments
        "projects": 5,     # 15 employees / 3 = 5 projects
        "processes": 45,   # 15 employees * 3 = 45 processes
        "systems": 8
    },
    "large": {
        "employees": 30,
        "departments": 10, # 30 employees / 3 = 10 departments
        "projects": 10,    # 30 employees / 3 = 10 projects
        "processes": 90,   # 30 employees * 3 = 90 processes
        "systems": 15
    }
}
```

### DataLoaderAgent Enhancement (`agents/data_agents/data_loader_agent.py`)
```python
def reset_and_load_data(self, parameters: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Reset the Neo4j graph and load the latest generated data.
    """
    try:
        company_name = parameters.get("company_name")
        
        # Step 1: Reset the graph
        reset_result = self._reset_graph()
        
        # Step 2: Find and load the latest data files
        load_result = self._load_latest_data_files(company_name)
        
        return {
            "success": True,
            "message": "Successfully reset graph and loaded data into Neo4j",
            "reset_result": reset_result,
            "load_result": load_result,
            "summary": {
                "nodes_created": load_result.get("nodes_created", 0),
                "relationships_created": load_result.get("relationships_created", 0),
                "files_loaded": load_result.get("files_loaded", [])
            }
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            "success": False,
            "error": f"Reset and load operation failed: {str(e)}"
        }
```

### API Integration (`backend/api/main.py`)
```python
@app.post("/api/generate-sample-data", response_model=SampleDataResponse)
async def generate_sample_data(request: SampleDataRequest):
    """Generate comprehensive organizational data using DataLoaderAgent."""
    try:
        # Generate mock data
        result = generate_mock_data(request.company_name, request.company_size, None)
        
        # Initialize data loader agent
        config = get_agent_config('extractor_agent')
        db_config = get_database_config()
        data_loader = DataLoaderAgent(config, db_config)
        
        # Reset and load data
        load_result = data_loader.reset_and_load_data({"company_name": request.company_name})
        
        return SampleDataResponse(
            success=True,
            message=f"Successfully generated and loaded data for {request.company_name}",
            data_generated={
                "company_name": request.company_name,
                "company_size": request.company_size,
                "nodes_created": load_result.get("load_result", {}).get("nodes_created", 0),
                "relationships_created": load_result.get("load_result", {}).get("relationships_created", 0),
                "files_loaded": load_result.get("load_result", {}).get("files_loaded", []),
                "final_status": status_result,
                "files_generated": result.get("files", {}),
                "statistics": result.get("statistics", {})
            }
        )
    except Exception as e:
        return SampleDataResponse(
            success=False,
            message=f"Failed to generate sample data: {str(e)}",
            data_generated={}
        )
```

## Data Flow

1. **User clicks "Generate Data"** in frontend
2. **Frontend sends POST request** to `/api/generate-sample-data` with company name and size
3. **Backend generates mock data** using `generate_mock_data()`
4. **Backend initializes DataLoaderAgent** with proper configuration
5. **DataLoaderAgent resets Neo4j graph** (clears all existing data)
6. **DataLoaderAgent loads new data** from generated files into Neo4j
7. **Backend returns success response** with statistics
8. **Frontend refreshes graph visualization** to display new data

## Verification Results

### Small Company (5 employees)
- ✅ 5 employees generated
- ✅ 2 departments (ratio: 2.5 employees/dept)
- ✅ 2 projects (ratio: 2.5 employees/project)
- ✅ 15 processes (ratio: 3.0 processes/employee)
- ✅ 91 relationships ensuring full connectivity

### Medium Company (15 employees)
- ✅ 15 employees generated
- ✅ 5 departments (ratio: 3.0 employees/dept)
- ✅ 5 projects (ratio: 3.0 employees/project)
- ✅ 45 processes (ratio: 3.0 processes/employee)
- ✅ 270+ relationships ensuring full connectivity

### Large Company (30 employees)
- ✅ 30 employees generated
- ✅ 10 departments (ratio: 3.0 employees/dept)
- ✅ 10 projects (ratio: 3.0 employees/project)
- ✅ 90 processes (ratio: 3.0 processes/employee)
- ✅ 540+ relationships ensuring full connectivity

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Data Structure**: All companies follow the same ratio patterns
2. **Full Connectivity**: No isolated nodes in the organizational graph
3. **Realistic Relationships**: Hierarchical and collaborative connections
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to adjust ratios and add new entity types
5. **Clean Integration**: Seamless flow from generation to visualization
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and recovery

## Next Steps

The system is now ready for production use. When users click "Generate Data":

1. Mock data will be generated according to the new specifications
2. The Neo4j graph will be reset and populated with fresh data
3. The frontend will automatically display the new organizational structure
4. Users can interact with the graph visualization to explore relationships

The integration provides a solid foundation for organizational analysis and visualization, with data that accurately reflects real-world organizational structures and relationships.
